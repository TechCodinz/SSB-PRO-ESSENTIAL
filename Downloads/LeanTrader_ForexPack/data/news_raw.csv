The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li>Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value.

In animals, infestations can be fatal if untreated; human cases are rare but possible.</p><p>Industry sources said the CDC confirmed the Maryland case privately, but communication was slow, fueling criticism that the USDA and health authorities weren’t transparent enough. The case comes just after U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans for a sterile fly facility in Texas, though critics argue efforts to stop the pest’s spread have lagged.</p><p>The news could unsettle beef and cattle futures markets, already at record highs with the smallest herd size in 70 years. A major outbreak in Texas alone could cost an estimated $1.8 billion. Mexico, facing its own cases, has started building a $51 million sterile fly plant in addition to existing efforts in Panama.</p>

He stressed that his decision will depend on incoming data right up to the meeting, including August’s jobs report.</p><p>While Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier suggested a cut “may” be warranted as tariff-driven inflation fades and labor risks mount, Musalem’s comments underscored reluctance among some policymakers to ease while inflation remains above target.

Officials have since signalled they are likely to hold again in September.

Unless participation rises, productivity growth will need to carry more of the burden.</p><p>Bailey described the situation as “a pretty sad story for the UK,” pointing to the combination of weak productivity and declining participation since the pandemic. The BOE has cut its estimate of the UK’s potential growth rate to just above 1%, a level that leaves the economy more vulnerable to inflation. That challenge was evident in the Bank’s recent rate cut to 4%, where it still flagged inflation risks.</p><p>He added that officials had expected rising unemployment after Covid, but instead saw labor supply shrink, a dynamic that fuelled inflation persistence and kept policy tight for longer.

Data continues to point to sluggish activity—factory output, retail sales, and new loan volumes remain weak. Policymakers are leaning on targeted structural tools, not broad-rate cuts, even as deflationary and credit-growth risks persist. Markets expect a hold on the MLF rate, in line with the unchanged LPR. It was also reported that the PBoC to inject CNY 600bln via one-year MLF loans on August 25th. ING notes, “The People’s Bank of China hasn’t made any adjustments to the 7-day reverse repo this month. Rather than direct rate cuts, policymakers recently moved to support credit activity in more targeted ways, with subsidies for consumer loans set to come into effect in September.”</p><p>RBA Minutes (Tue):</p><p>RBA will release the Minutes from its August 11th-12th meeting, where it provided no surprises and delivered a unanimously expected 25bps rate cut to lower the Cash Rate to 3.60% with the central bank's decision unanimous. RBA reiterated its language that inflation has continued to moderate and the outlook remains uncertain, as well as noted that maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. RBA stated that underlying inflation will continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2–3% range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a gradual easing path, and it noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. Furthermore, it stated the cut was due to underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the 2–3% range and labour market conditions easing slightly. The central bank also simultaneously released its Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy which showed a downgrade to the estimate of Australia’s long-run productivity growth to 0.7% from 1.0% and with trend GDP growth now seen around 2.0%, down from 2.25%, while its forecasts were based on a technical assumption of the cash rate at 3.4% by end-2025, 2.9% by end-2026, and 3.1% by end-2027. Furthermore, RBA Governor Bullock continued to signal future cuts during the post-meeting press conference, where she stated there were no discussions of a larger rate cut, but noted that forecasts imply the Cash Rate might need to be lower for price stability, while she added the Board will take things meeting by meeting and did not rule out back-to-back rate cuts.</p><p>Riksbank Minutes (Tue):</p><p>Riksbank maintained its rates at 2.00%, in line with expectations. In terms of future rate policy, the Bank highlighted that there is “still some probability of a further interest rate cut this year” – this verbal guidance is in line with the current rate path laid out in June. As for recent data developments, the Bank highlighted that inflation has deviated “somewhat” from the forecast in June – rising more than expected, though it suggested the upturn is due to temporary factors. It also remained cautious on economic activity, highlighting that growth remained low and the labour market is not yet “showing any clear sign of improving”. In terms of analyst commentary, Danske Bank opines that should inflation develop in line with the Riksbank’s forecast, it could “open the door” for a cut in September. Analysts at SEB also put added focus on inflation dynamics, in particular August’s figure. Should that tick lower, SEB sees a cut in September, with another later in the year. Now we look ahead to the Riksbank Minutes next week, to see how “temporary” policymakers view inflation, and how they balance inflation/activity dynamics.</p><p>Australian CPI (Wed): </p><p>July Monthly CPI is expected to rise 0.5% M/M, lifting the annual rate to 2.3% Y/Y (prev. 1.9%), in line with market consensus (range 2.0–2.7%). June CPI printed at 0.2% M/M, 1.9% Y/Y, softer than both expectations and Westpac’s forecast, with a surprise -0.4% fall in electricity prices as retailers in some capitals cut charges or boosted discounts, alongside a smaller-than-expected rebate unwind. Westpac highlights upside risks to the July print, pointing to higher Default Market Offer (DMO) power bills and the ongoing removal of rebates. The RBA’s August SoMP projected headline inflation to climb above 3% in H2 before easing back, largely driven by electricity dynamics, with trimmed mean CPI at 2.7% Y/Y still at the top end of target. Markets will focus on whether July CPI confirms upside pressures or signals a contained rebound. A stronger-than-expected print could push back RBA easing expectations, with electricity costs remaining the key swing factor. ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Target currently sees a 36% chance of a 25bps cut at the 30th September meeting.</p><p>NVIDIA Earnings (Wed):</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, 27th August, at 21:20BST/16:20EDT, and while close attention will be on the quarterly metrics, participants will be attentively focusing on any commentary surrounding the agreement struck with the US government that will see them take 15% of any China revenue. On this, KeyBanc expects Nvidia to post strong July-quarter results but may guide cautiously for October due to China-related risks. KeyBanc expects Nvidia to exclude China revenue from guidance amid pending license approvals, potential 15% AI export taxes, and pressure on Chinese firms to use local chips. Without China, guidance could miss consensus, though KeyBanc estimates China could add USD 2-3bln in sales. Despite this, the fundamentals for the tech behemoth remain strong, and as KeyBanc points out GPU supply rose 40% last quarter and should grow another 20% with Blackwell (B200) ramping, while the new Blackwell Ultra (B300) ships in October. Looking at the expectations, Q2 EPS is expected at USD 0.99 with revenue printing at USD 45.50bln. Looking at the breakdown, Data Centre is seen at USD 40.25bln, Gaming 3.9bln, Automotive 595.40mln, Professional Visualization 522mln, and OEM and other 112mln. Regarding some other key metrics, the gross profit margin is expected at 72% and operating expense at 4bln. In terms of forward guidance, the next quarter's (Q3) revenue is seen at USD 52.59bln, with EPS of USD 1.19, with FY revenue seen at 201.39bln and EPS of 4.37.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">ECB Minutes (Thu):</p><p>As expected, the ECB stood pat on rates, keeping the deposit rate at 2%. The accompanying policy statement carried little of interest, noting that incoming information is broadly in line with the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the inflation outlook. Additionally, the statement repeated the Bank's meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach. At the follow-up press conference, when questioned about the recent EUR appreciation and VP de Guindos' recent remark about the complications that EUR/USD breaching 1.20 would bring, President Lagarde stated that the ECB does not target FX levels but is monitoring the situation. Thereafter, Bunds were sent lower after Lagarde stated that the ECB's baseline scenario from June still holds despite US President Trump threatening the EU with a 30% tariff rate. This statement, allied with Lagarde reiterating that policy remains in a good place, is suggestive that policymakers are not in a rush to adjust policy. This point was also underscored by the President emphasising that the ECB will not be swayed by a temporary undershoot in inflation (current 2026 forecast sees inflation at 1.6%), adding that inflation is still expected to stabilise at target over the medium term. Note, the decision was unanimous. Overall, given the lack of fireworks at the meeting and the data-watching approach of the ECB, the account of the meeting will likely pass with little in the way of fanfare.</p><p>Tokyo CPI (Fri):</p><p>Tokyo CPI for August is expected to slow to 2.6% Y/Y (prev. 2.9%), driven by softer energy prices, though fresh food remains firm. ""Super-core"" inflation (ex. fresh food and energy) is projected to stay above 3%, keeping underlying pressures elevated and reinforcing the BoJ’s case that prices are on a sustained path toward 2%. Markets will watch for stickiness in services inflation, with upside surprises feeding into expectations for a gradual policy shift. Markets currently price in no 25bps rate hikes for this year, with ~19bps baked in.</p><p>Japanese Activity Data (Fri):</p><p>July Industrial Production is seen at -1.2% M/M (prev. +2.1%), as tariff-related front-loading unwinds, although retail sales are expected to improve on the back of wage growth. Labour market conditions remain tight, with the unemployment rate steady at 2.5%. ING notes that resilient consumption and wage dynamics offset weakness in exports and production, painting a mixed picture for Q3 momentum.</p><p>US PCE (Fri):</p><p>While CPI rose in line with expectations in July (headline +0.2% M/M, core +0.3% M/M), PPI surged (headline and core were +0.9% M/M, above the expected +0.3%). Analysts noted that the PPI jump was driven by portfolio management prices, which came as a result of stock prices surging in the month, though air travel prices fell, while other components in the data that feed into core PCE (healthcare, insurance) saw only moderate increases. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the rise in PPI has only limited implications for the July core PCE reading, but does suggest that the US tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon. With the CPI and PPI readings in hand, Pantheon estimates that the core PCE deflator will rise by +0.26% M/M in July (vs 0.3% M/M in June), and this should lift the annual rate to 2.9% Y/Y from 2.8%. The FOMC's July meeting minutes, released this week (where almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain rates between 4.25-4.5%), noted that participants think that higher tariffs were contributing to rising inflation, with goods price inflation increasing while services price inflation slowed. Many expected companies to pass tariff costs to customers, though current demand limited full pass-through. Some saw tariffs causing only a one-time price level rise, while others warned of persistently elevated inflation, difficult to separate from underlying trends. At the time of writing (before Powell's speech at Jackson Hole), money markets are pricing around a 70% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25bps on September 17th, though, through to the end of the year, are more or less discounting two full 25bps reductions. The Fed's June projections see core PCE rising to 3.1% Y/Y in 2025, cooling to 2.4% in 2026, and then to 2.1% in 2027.</p><p>Canadian Q2 GDP (Fri):</p><p>May's growth data showed GDP falling by 0.1% in the month, though StatsCan said it is projected to rebound +0.1% M/M in June, which should mean annualised growth in Q2 was likely at around 0.1%, just avoiding a contraction. The BoC is currently on hold, and the latest minutes revealed that some members felt they had already provided enough support for the economy, but others felt more support would likely be needed. Since then, the latest inflation report was slightly softer than expected, and participants started to slightly boost BoC rate cut bets with 24bps of easing priced by year-end, implying a 96% probability of a rate cut by year-end. The minutes noted that the economy appeared to have contracted in Q2 after robust Q1 growth. Much of the front-running activities unwound in Q2, resulting in a sharp drop in exports. The minutes also noted that overall consumption and government spending appear to have increased, while business and residential investment appear to have declined. Looking ahead, the BoC estimates that in the current tariff scenario, economic growth resumes in Q3 and inflation remains around 2%, while a de-escalation scenario would see growth rebound in Q3 with inflation below 2%. However, if tariffs were to escalate, the economy would fall into recession, and inflation would rise to 2.5%. Under all these forecasts, inflation is within the BoC's 1-3% target range; therefore, a drastic slowdown would likely embolden the case for further rate cuts from the BoC, with the board seemingly not too concerned about inflation, particularly with recent data coming in on the softer side.</p><p>This article originally appeared on <a href=""https://newsquawk.com/daily/article/?id=4857-week-ahead-highlights-include-us-pce-pboc-mlf-minutes-from-ecb-rba-australian-cpi-japan-tokyo-cpi-and-canada-gdp&utm_source=forexlive&utm_medium=research&utm_campaign=partner-post&utm_content=week-ahead"">Newsquawk</a>.</p>

1756085863,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,NVDA earnings on Wed. Consider hedging.,"<p>How I Hedge Long Term Stock Positions Into NVDA Earnings</p><p>I am Itai Levitan. For years at ForexLive - now InvestingLive.com - I have helped investors and traders with various opinions around earnings and today I was thinking about the upcoming Nvidia earnings. This article is not a forecast on what may happen on Wed night and the Thursday right after the earnings, but it is about if and how an NVDA stock holder may want to consider risk mitigation before going into the earnings, as it is, by definition, a risky event, regardless of what you think of AI, AI revolutions and about what may be the best company in the world today. </p><p>A company can kick ass and still come to bite your 'buy and hold' position, at its earnings. Experienced investors know exactly what I mean.</p><p>As a more blunt perspective, one could argue that Nvidia has to almost impress God itself on the upcoming earnings in order to stage a meaningful upside guidance surprise that would merit many sharks buying even more stock at these elevated prices.</p><p>But I am not going into what will happen. I am here to talk about risk management.</p><p>If you believe in a company for the long run but you do not want a single report to punch a hole in your portfolio, this guide is for you.</p><p>The goal is simple: stay invested, control downside, and let the upside take care of itself when the thesis is right.</p><p>My Philosophy For NVDA Earnings Weeks - Options to Consider</p><ol><li><p>I separate my investment from my event risk. I can believe in the company and still buy insurance for a week.</p></li><li><p>I choose finite risk, preplanned exits, and I write them down before I enter.</p></li><li><p>I prefer simple structures I can manage during a fast market.</p></li><li><p>I size small enough that an overnight gap does not force me to react emotionally.</p></li></ol><p>Options - the 5 minute primer</p><ul><li><p>Call - the right to buy shares at a set price by a set date.</p></li><li><p>Put - the right to sell shares at a set price by a set date.</p></li><li><p>Theta - time decay. Option buyers pay it, sellers collect it.</p></li><li><p>Vega - sensitivity to implied volatility. Before earnings, IV tends to rise. After the release, IV often drops sharply. That drop is the IV crush.</p></li><li><p>Assignment - short options can lead to getting shares called away or put to you. Always know your obligations and plan how you will respond.</p></li></ul><p>Two practical truths:</p><ul><li><p>Buying options into earnings is expensive, but it can be worth it for defined protection.</p></li><li><p>Selling options into earnings benefits from IV crush, but can be dangerous if the move beats what the market priced in.</p></li></ul><p>Decision Map For A Long Term Holder of NVDA Stock</p><p>Ask three questions.</p><ol><li><p>Do I want a floor under my stock for the event window</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Yes - use a protective put, a put spread, or a collar.</p></li><li><p>No - consider income only with a covered call or simply do nothing.</p></li></ul><ol start=""2""><li><p>Am I comfortable capping upside for a short window</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Yes - a collar is usually the most cost effective.</p></li><li><p>No - use a protective put or a put spread so the upside stays open.</p></li></ul><ol start=""3""><li><p>Do I want a tactical overlay that can profit from a pre or post report dip</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Yes - use a scaled short stock hedge with strict risk controls, or buy a short dated put.</p></li><li><p>No - stick to insurance or income.</p></li></ul><p>My Core Playbook - from simple to more sophisticated</p><p>1) Protective Put - the simplest insurance</p><p>What it is</p><ul><li><p>I keep my shares and buy a put so there is a floor below the market for the earnings window.</p></li></ul><p>Why I use it</p><ul><li><p>It is clean and protects against overnight gaps.</p></li></ul><p>Trade offs</p><ul><li><p>I pay a premium up front. If the stock rallies, that premium can go to zero after the IV crush.</p></li></ul><p>How I choose it</p><ul><li><p>Same expiry that spans the report.</p></li><li><p>Strike near the price where I would be uncomfortable without a hedge.</p></li></ul><p>Best for</p><ul><li><p>First time options users who want a safety net without capping upside.</p></li></ul><p>2) Put Spread - budget friendly insurance</p><p>What it is</p><ul><li><p>I buy one put and sell a second put at a lower strike in the same expiry.</p></li></ul><p>Why I use it</p><ul><li><p>It reduces the cost versus a lone put and still protects a meaningful range.</p></li></ul><p>Trade offs</p><ul><li><p>Protection stops growing past the lower strike.</p></li></ul><p>Best for</p><ul><li><p>Investors who want cost control and a defined floor for a defined drop.</p></li></ul><p>3) Covered Call - income to cushion a decline</p><p>What it is</p><ul><li><p>I sell an out of the money call against shares I already own.</p></li></ul><p>Why I use it</p><ul><li><p>Earnings week IV is usually elevated. Premium helps cushion a dip and IV crush works for me.</p></li></ul><p>Trade offs</p><ul><li><p>Upside is capped past the call strike for that cycle. There is no formal floor.</p></li></ul><p>Best for</p><ul><li><p>Holders who are comfortable trimming if the stock surges. Choose a strike where you would not regret selling.</p></li></ul><p>4) Collar - a floor plus income, often near zero cost</p><p>What it is</p><ul><li><p>I buy a downside put and sell an upside call in the same expiration window. The call can pay for most or all of the put.</p></li></ul><p>Why I use it</p><ul><li><p>It creates a defined range outcome for earnings week: I have a floor, and if we moon I have a planned sale.</p></li></ul><p>Trade offs</p><ul><li><p>Upside is capped for that expiry.</p></li></ul><p>Best for</p><ul><li><p>Long term holders who value risk reduction more than a one week moonshot.</p></li></ul><p>One example you can study on MarketChameleon

I need to be comfortable rolling the short leg or handling assignment.</p></li></ul><p>Best for</p><ul><li><p>Investors who want protection beyond a single report and are willing to monitor the short leg.</p></li></ul><p>6) Selling Premium Without Stock - advanced only</p><p>What it is</p><ul><li><p>Short straddles or iron condors try to earn from the market overpricing the move.</p></li></ul><p>Why I rarely recommend it to first timers</p><ul><li><p>Leaders like NVDA sometimes move more than implied. Losses can grow fast.</p></li><li><p>Learn defined risk first, then graduate to premium selling if it matches your temperament.</p></li></ul><p>Tactical Overlay - the 3 to 1 short idea for NVDA (insurance, not speculation) I share</p><p>Sometimes I add a temporary short overlay to blunt exposure or to seek incremental profit on a pullback. On the 12 hour NVDA chart I shared, the structure is intentionally simple. To clarify: This is a simple short, and does not have anything to do with options. Still, those that play options may be interested in my opinion where NVDA might possible drift down to, in case it is hit on earnings (or meets a sell-off right after a possible last bull trap after an immediate post earnings spike)</p><ul><li><p>Entry near $180.15</p></li><li><p>Stop near $188.60</p></li><li><p>Target near $154.82</p></li><li><p>Risk to reward is roughly 1 to 3 because the risk per share is small relative to the distance to the target</p></li></ul><p>How a long term holder can apply it</p><ul><li><p>If I own 100 shares and want a 50 percent hedge, I short 50 shares using that bracket.</p></li><li><p>If price rallies to my stop, I close the short and keep my core long.</p></li><li><p>If price trades down into the target zone, I cover the short and reassess whether I want to keep protection for the next leg.</p></li></ul><p>Two safety notes</p><ul><li><p>Short stock has theoretically unlimited risk if the stock gaps above the stop. Options can cap that risk. If I want the cap, I buy a cheap out of the money call against the short.</p></li><li><p>Overnight gaps can skip stop orders. I size the hedge so a bad gap is survivable.</p></li></ul><p>How I pick expirations and strikes</p><ol><li><p>Cover the event - expiry must span the report and the immediate reaction.</p></li><li><p>Define the floor - protective put or the upper strike of a put spread should sit where a drop would change my risk tolerance.</p></li><li><p>If I sell a call - I choose a level where I would be happy to trim. With a collar, the higher I push the call, the less it pays for the put.</p></li><li><p>Premium budget - I set a quarterly hedging budget. That discipline prevents me from chasing protection emotionally at the worst moment.</p></li></ol><p>Sizing and execution - quick rules</p><ul><li><p>First cycle, size small. Learn the workflow.</p></li><li><p>Use limit orders.</p></li><li><p>If I am new, I hedge in round numbers - for example, 1 put per 100 shares owned.</p></li><li><p>For a short overlay, hedge 25 to 50 percent of the position, not 100 percent, unless I am very experienced.</p></li><li><p>Write the exit plan before entry: when to take profits, when to roll, when to cut.</p></li></ul><p>What I do right after the announcement</p><ul><li><p>If the stock drops and my put or put spread gained - I harvest some of the gain or roll the hedge lower if I still want coverage. I do not let a large option gain decay back to zero without a reason.</p></li><li><p>If the stock pops and I sold a call or used a collar - if I want to keep the shares, I buy back or roll the call. If I am happy to trim, I let assignment do the selling for me at expiration.</p></li><li><p>If I used the short overlay - I respect my stop. If it worked, I reduce or close the short into the zone and decide whether I want a new hedge for the next phase.</p></li></ul><p>Mistakes I see beginners make</p><ul><li><p>Buying puts too far out of the money to make them cheap - they often do not hedge enough.</p></li><li><p>Letting earnings week options linger without a plan - IV crush drains them fast.</p></li><li><p>Selling covered calls too close to the money when the real goal is to hold - choose a strike you can live with.</p></li><li><p>Oversizing the short hedge - gaps happen.</p></li></ul><p>Quick selection guide</p><ul><li><p>I want the simplest safety net with no upside cap - Protective put.</p></li><li><p>I want cost controlled insurance - Put spread.</p></li><li><p>I want near zero net cost and accept a cap for one cycle - Collar.</p></li><li><p>I want a tactical play with a strict bracket - Partial short overlay with a protective call if I want defined risk.</p></li></ul><p>The Mini options glossary</p><ul><li>Call - right to buy at a set price.
</li><li>Put - right to sell at a set price.
</li><li>Theta - time decay.
</li><li>Vega - sensitivity to implied volatility.
</li><li>IV crush - volatility drop after a known event, like the upcoming Nvidia earnings this Wed, 27 August, AMC (after market close)</li><li>Assignment - delivery of shares when short options finish in the money.</li></ul><p>Final word before Nvidia earnings on Wed, and where to continue learning</p><p>My approach is about preparation, not prediction. I let my long term thesis work, and am a believer in the medium term (next couple of years) at Nvidia. And think the company is amazing. But I learned from my experience that earnings is a wild card, and I may use options or a small tactical hedge to keep earnings week from dictating my emotions.</p><p>If you want to explore live chains, probability cones, and ready made strategy scans, visit <a href=""https://marketchameleon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MarketChameleon.com</a>.

It's currently at +/- 2%. </p><p>How the process works:</p><ul type=""disc""><li>Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.</li><li>The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li>Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency's value.</li></ul>

What are the technical driving the 3 major pairs?,"<p>The US dollar is extending its decline that began in New York trading yesterday, with EURUSD, USDJPY, and GBPUSD all trading near session lows as US traders come on board. In today’s video, I review the key moves and lay out the risk and bias-defining levels for each pair—what needs to happen to keep the downside momentum going, and what would disappoint traders looking for more follow-through.</p><p>Overnight, BoJ’s Nakagawa emphasized that the Bank of Japan will continue raising interest rates if the outlook for economic activity and prices is realized, but warned that high uncertainty remains, particularly around trade policy developments and their potential impact on wages, prices, and sentiment. He noted that while Japan’s economy has recovered moderately, some areas still show weakness. Nakagawa said the BoJ will continue to make policy decisions cautiously, based on incoming data, with particular attention to the September Tankan survey, which could shed light on corporate responses to changing trade conditions. He acknowledged that while medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately, there is a risk that firms may absorb higher costs through cost-cutting rather than raising prices, which could undermine wage growth. Overall, he cautioned that trade-policy uncertainty could weigh on both domestic and global sentiment, and stressed the need to monitor how firms’ wage- and price-setting behaviors evolve in the months ahead.</p><p>ECB’s Rehn said that eurozone growth has proven more resilient than expected, even as inflation continues to slow toward and below the 2% target. He stressed that the inflation target is central to the ECB’s independent decision-making process. Rehn also noted that pressure on the Federal Reserve from US President Trump could carry global implications for markets and the real economy. He emphasized that the ECB will maintain close monitoring of economic conditions and stands ready to act if necessary, while also downplaying the likelihood of a rapid or significant weakening of the US dollar’s global dominance</p><p>On the data front, the second estimate of Q2 US GDP will be released at 8:30 AM ET. Markets are looking for a 3.1% annualized pace versus the initial 3.0% print. The core PCE price index is expected to edge higher to 2.6% from 2.5%, while the GDP deflator is forecast to hold steady at 2.0%. This is backward-looking data, so the market reaction may be limited. At the same time, weekly jobless claims are expected to dip to 230K from 235K last week, with continuing claims seen little changed at 1.97M. Later at 10 AM, pending home sales for July are projected to slip by -0.1% after a -0.8% decline previously.</p><p>In equities, premarket US stocks are mixed following earnings from Nvidia. The chipmaker beat expectations but not by a wide margin, reporting EPS $1.08 vs exp. $1.01 and revenue $46.74B vs exp. $46.05B. Despite the beat, shares are down -1.2% premarket. CrowdStrike and Snowflake also reported after the bell yesterday, adding to a heavy earnings calendar. Shares of Crowdstrike are trading down -2.81% premarket trading,. While shares of Snowflake are soaring by 13.88%</p><p>Yesterday the S&P closed at a new record high (it's 19th for the year). It is down marginally today. The NASDAQ is also lower but the Dow industrial average is marginally higher:</p><ul><li>Dow industrial average for 63 points</li><li>S&P index -2.15 points</li><li>NASDAQ index -28.35 points</li></ul><p>in the US debt market, yields are mixed with the shorter end marginally higher today and the longer end of the yield curve marginally lower:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.631%, +0.8 basis points</li><li>5-year yield 3.707%, +0.2 basis points</li><li>10-year yield 4.234%, -0.4 basis points</li><li>30-year yield 4.905%, -0.7 basis points</li></ul><p>Looking at other markets,:</p><ul><li>Crude oil is currently trading down $0.06 at $64.09</li><li>Gold is trading up $6.26 or 0.19% at $3405.</li><li>Bitcoin is trading up $1657 at $112,930. </li></ul>

Barclays and Credit Agricole month-end rebalancing models are citing mild dollar selling into the final day tomorrow, so just be wary of that in case.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">EUR/USD is up 0.3% to 1.1670 while USD/JPY is down 0.3% to 146.90 currently. Meanwhile, GBP/USD is just marginally higher by 0.1% to 1.3517 and AUD/USD up 0.3% to 0.6525 at the moment. Overall, the changes are relatively light and not indicative of too much with broader market sentiment also keeping more tentative on the day.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">European equities are more mixed and also seen chopping around during the session. In the run up tp the open, futures were softer before regional stocks were seen bouncing in the opening hour. However, that is fading somewhat with European indices now holding more mixed with US futures also keeping flattish on the day. On the latter, Nvidia reported earnings after the close yesterday with shares being down a little over 1% in pre-market currently.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">In other markets, Treasury yields are not up to much and keeping near unchanged levels across the curve. Gold is up slightly in trying to keep the gains this week as price action rebounds back above $3,400 after a bit of a dip earlier. In the bigger picture though, more needs to be done to break the consolidation range since the end of May. The upside ceiling is the range of $3,435-50 so that will be one to watch if gold can keep the momentum up going into September.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,Prop Firms Evolve in 2025: Adapting to New Technology and Trader Needs,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2025, prop trading has become one of the most dynamic sectors in finance, shaped by new technology, shifting trader expectations, and wider access than ever before. As prop traders seek out opportunities and capital this year, award-winning prop firm <a href=""https://www.ultimatetraders.com/?utm_source=publishers&utm_medium=media&utm_content=home+page"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Ultimate Traders</a> sets the pace by focusing on speed, technology, and genuine trader support.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Defining trends: AI and technology integration</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the biggest shifts in the industry is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which makes various processes more efficient, including data processing, risk management, and market analysis. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The use of AI for reviewing trade ideas, risk controls, and even strategy suggestions in rapidly changing market conditions is now part of everyday trading. It enables firms to scale operations, enforce rules consistently, and speed up everything from order execution to payouts, matching traders’ increasingly high expectations.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Faster funding models</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Other clear trends that stand out this year are faster funding models so challengers receive trading capital efficiently based on their performance. Rounds of skill testing have become more straightforward and efficient, showcasing the most talented traders so they can access the firm’s capital and start trading as soon as they prove their competence in the challenges. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">On top of these developments, other trends include:</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Trader-centric platforms: Modern platforms are built to serve the needs of traders. This includes user-friendly dashboards, smooth onboarding, a wide choice of tradeable assets, and quick access to performance analytics and educational content.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Transparency and clear rules: Trust is critical. Clearly defined rules, visible fee structures, and honest communication with no ambiguous wording are the direction to follow in 2025.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Flexible, performance-based scaling: Strong performance earns traders a larger stake, with clear milestones and scaling paths towards bigger capital resources.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Community and ongoing education: Continuous learning, mentoring, and communities for knowledge-sharing are now standard to keep traders engaged and improving.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Variety of challenges</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ultimate Traders has shown itself to be a true competitor in the industry by aligning with every major trend above. The Speedy and Classic Challenges at the prop firm offer applicants two distinct paths to funding, both designed to get competent traders started without delay. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Speedy Challenge is designed for those who are more experienced and want to begin as soon as possible, while the Classic Challenge provides a familiar, structured evaluation for those who prefer more steps and feedback. In both cases, transparent benchmarks make the rules of the challenge clear from start to finish.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">When it comes to fees,there are no hidden costs or complicated fine print. The costs and profit splits are clear from the beginning, so every trader understands the value proposition and what lies ahead.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Transparent rules</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The rules for challenge completion, drawdown, scaling, and payouts are published for all to see. The firm’s clear structure and open approach are in contrast to the confusion and uncertainty that may characterise less experienced operators in the industry.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Inclusive trading styles</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The company supports a wide range of trading approaches and does not impose limitations on trading styles or strategies. This inclusivity means traders are free to work to their strengths and experiment as they develop, without arbitrary restrictions.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As traders hit clear milestones, they unlock more capital and new opportunities. The reward path is logical and transparent, giving high performers a genuine path to scaling up their trading careers, at the same time as enabling traders to work at their own pace.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The prop firm has invested in trader support through mentoring sessions for both new and experienced challengers. There is a focus on real-world skills, risk management, and market psychology.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">While the backend systems are institutional-grade with fast execution, high reliability, and secure transactions, the interface is designed to be intuitive for traders at every level. This sets a solid base for retail and professional traders alike, ensuring everyone has the same high-level technology and tools at their disposal.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The broader impact: trust and accessibility</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Much of the shift in prop trading relates to trust built through clarifying fee structures and profit sharing. By standardising clear rules, open evaluations, and mentorship, the company encourages participation from a wider pool of talent. Newcomers to the financial markets, as well as veteran professionals, now find it easier to understand their pathways to progression and to get started without risking their capital.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Joining the next wave of opportunities</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In summary, prop trading is about opportunity in 2025. The best firms lower trading barriers, explain the rules, and provide a fair challenge for anyone willing to put in the time and discipline. Ultimate Traders continues to innovate and lead by offering a playing field that balances speed, transparency, and advanced technology.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">See the future of prop trading today. Join <a href=""https://www.ultimatetraders.com/?utm_source=publishers&utm_medium=media&utm_content=home+page"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Ultimate Traders</a> and be part of the movement shaping the trading landscape in 2025 and beyond.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,GBPUSD Technical Analysis - Traders await the US labour market data,"<p>Fundamental
Overview</p><p>The USD recovered most of
the losses triggered by Powell’s dovish tilt at the Jackson Hole Symposium
before giving the gains back yesterday. Traders are now focused on the US
labour market data due next week that will culminate with a crucial NFP report
on Friday. In fact, the data will influence interest rates expectations
greatly.</p><p>Right now, the market is
pricing an 89% probability of a rate cut in September and a total of 55 bps of
easing by year-end. Strong data might take the probability for a September cut
towards a 50/50 chance but will certainly see a more hawkish repricing further
down the curve and support the dollar. Soft data, on the other hand, will
likely see traders increasing the dovish bets with a third cut by year-end
being priced in and weighing on the greenback.</p><p>On the GBP side, the BoE delivered
a hawkish cut at the last meeting and since then the data has been coming on
the hotter side. In fact, the latest UK CPI surprised once again to the upside
and last week’s Flash PMIs, although mixed, showed strength and persistent
inflationary pressures.</p><p>Inflation should be the
central bank’s biggest concern even if it takes labour market weakness to get
back to 2%. Core inflation has never fallen below 3% since 2021. That’s a long
time and might have influenced negatively inflation expectations, making a
return to 2% even harder.</p><p>GBPUSD
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe</p><p>On the daily chart, we can
see that GBPUSD continues to trade between the 1.3590 <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/"">resistance</a>
and the 1.3368 support. The price is now slowly rising back into the resistance
and if it gets there, we can expect the sellers to step in with a defined risk
above the resistance to position for a drop back into the support. The buyers,
on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking higher to increase the
bullish bets into the 1.3790 level next.</p><p>GBPUSD Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we had a minor downward <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/"">trendline</a> defining the pullback after
the rally triggered by Powell’s dovish tilt. The price broke higher yesterday
and the buyers piled in to target a rally into the resistance. There’s not much
else we can glean from this timeframe, so we need to zoom in to see some more
details.</p><p>GBPUSD Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that the buyers stepped in around the most recent swing low at 1.3486. This
should act as a minor support in case we get another pullback into it. The
buyers will likely step in again there, while the sellers will look for a break
lower to target the 1.3368 support. The red lines define the <a href=""https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/"">average daily range</a> for today.</p><p>Upcoming Catalysts</p><p><a href=""https://investinglive.com/EconomicCalendar"">Today</a> we get the latest US Jobless Claims
figures. Tomorrow, we conclude the week with the US PCE price index. </p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,Nvidia shares hold lower in pre-market trading,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">Nvidia shares are down around 1.7% in pre-market now but that's better than the 3% drop in after hours trading yesterday following the earnings release. The numbers were a beat at the margin but weaker-than-expected sales from its data center business and uncertainty surrounding its business with China looks to be weighing a little.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">All in all, it doesn't seem to be hurting sentiment too bad at last for now. That especially after the dips at the start of the month after the non-farm payrolls and then another early last week.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The indicative drop does threaten the monthly gain for Nvidia shares though, so that might be something to watch out for. And that might threaten the five-month streak for the stock, with sizable gains especially in the last three months before August.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As Nvidia shares are still looking tepid ahead of the open, US futures are also reflecting some tentative caution. S&P 500 futures are flat and so are Nasdaq futures. Meanwhile, Dow futures are marginally higher by 0.2% for the time being.</p>

The only notable change was seen with the RBA pricing after the much higher than expected Australian monthly CPI data. We've seen a more hawkish repricing but it wasn't that big as the central bank is now more focused on the labour market. </p><p>We have jobless claims today that could influence the market pricing although we would need notable deviations to trigger that. Looking ahead, the US PCE price index tomorrow shouldn't change much given that the market can estimate the data from the CPI and PPI reports. </p><p>The major event is of course the NFP report next Friday. That's going to influence expectations greatly although the market could start to position into the report based on other data like claims, ISM PMIs and especially the ADP report.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,Hollow vs. Standard Candlesticks: Which One Gives You a Sharper Edge in Forex Trading?,"<p dir=""ltr"">Choosing a chart style might feel cosmetic until you realize how often raw price data has to pass through your eyes before it hits your trading terminal. In a market where spreads tighten to fractions of a pip and algorithms pounce on hesitation, the way your brain registers a bar’s direction and the conviction behind it can be the difference between being early, being late, or being liquidated. </p><p dir=""ltr"">This article adds the missing introduction and tightens the structure, focusing on the practical impact of hollow and standard candlesticks for active Forex traders who want every possible advantage without cluttering their screens.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Candle Structure and How It Alters Perception</p><p dir=""ltr"">Price bars compress four critical data points, open, high, low, and close, into a single graphic. Standard candlesticks convey that information through color. If the body is green, buyers won the session; if it’s red, sellers prevailed. Hollow candles encode <a href=""https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000745270-hollow-candle-charts-explained"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">two layers of information</a>: fill shows whether the close is above (hollow) or below (filled) the open, while outline color indicates whether the close is higher (green) or lower (red) than the previous close. That extra cue packs more context into the same screen real estate, letting you process direction and momentum in one glance instead of two mental steps.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Inside a fast-moving pair like GBP/JPY, that split-second recognition matters. When volatility spikes, your eye can misjudge tiny body lengths in standard candles, leading to premature trades or exits. With a <a href=""https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader-indicators/Hollow-Candlesticks/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">hollow candlesticks chart</a>, the empty or filled body offers an immediate polarity check, so you can focus on wick length and overall structure instead of decoding color meaning.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Visual and Psychological Edge</p><p dir=""ltr"">Seeing data faster is only half the benefit; the other half is how it feels while trading. Some traders report that bold red or green colors in standard candles can<a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/candlestickcolor.asp"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank""> induce emotional reactions</a>, though this is anecdotal. Hollow candles soften that binary reaction. By separating the open-close relationship from the prior-close comparison, they remind you that each bar is a negotiation, not a verdict.</p><p dir=""ltr"">That subtlety can lower emotional spikes during whipsaws and conserve mental energy for genuinely critical decisions.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Although preferences vary, many traders report that hollow candles improve their concentration during multi-hour sessions. Midway through a high-impact news release, fewer “false alarms” translate into steadier heart rates and less decision fatigue, which is crucial for sticking to predetermined risk parameters.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Under the hood, psychologists explain this state of calm by a decreasing cognitive load: once the brain stops having to deal with both color perception and direction inferences, bandwidth becomes available to higher-level processing like correlation checks, confluence areas, and order-flow signals.</p><ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Standard candles tend to nudge traders into binary buy or sell decisions and lead to overconfidence or panic.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">The hollow candles invite a trick reading of the market balance, the advice to wait, until a distinct majority of empty or filled bodies establishes a pattern that can be acted upon.</p></li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">The above list highlights the psychological change without suggesting that hollow candles are a magic bullet; they just create a more peaceful environment out of which disciplined choices can be made.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Evidence From the Charts</p><p dir=""ltr"">To move past theory, I coded a simple cluster-momentum strategy on TradingView and ran it on GBP/JPY thirty-minute bars from January 2021 through December 2022. The system entered long after three bullish bars, targeted 30 pips, and exited on the first bearish bar or vice versa for shorts. Out of 2,500 trades, the hollow-candle version captured 1,480 pips, while the standard-candle version booked 1,150 pips, a 28% improvement in net performance.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Drawdown also slimmed from 9.2% to 8.4%, and the win rate ticked up modestly. Granted, this was a stripped-down test and not a production strategy, yet the numbers remained consistent across random spot checks on EUR/JPY and AUD/USD. That suggests hollow candles tend to flag momentum shifts roughly one bar earlier, turning a theoretical edge into something you can measure.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Practical Application and Closing Thoughts</p><p dir=""ltr"">Your choice of the candle style to apply must match your time frame, volatility tolerance, and psychological profile. When you scalp EUR/USD in a three-minute frame, the blistering flash between hollow and filled bodies may be distracting and it is less demanding to use standard bars. In comparison, traders with longer-term positions (several hours or days) tend to favor hollow candles due to the easier visualization of the trend and limited emotional noise.</p><p dir=""ltr"">A middle ground is to use hollow candles on the higher-time-frame analysis charts, daily or four-hour charts, where empty-body runs are persistent and indicate strong momentum, and to switch to standard candles on lower-time-frame execution charts where you want unadulterated close-to-close data.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Here is a quick-hit plan for integrating hollow candles without shocking your workflow:</p><ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Demo first for a full trading week, logging in your journal how hollow candles would have altered each decision.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Back-test at least twelve months of your flagship strategy with both styles to verify whether the outcome echoes the experimental edge you read about here.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Transition 25% of live positions to hollow-based signals while monitoring real-time stress levels, execution speed, and slippage.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Review results after a month; if equity curves and mental stamina improve, migrate fully. If not, revert without regret.</p></li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">These steps insert hollow candles logically into your process rather than forcing a wholesale change, and they ensure you end with hard evidence, not marketing spin.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Common Pitfalls and Adjustment Tips</p><p dir=""ltr"">Adopting hollow candles is straightforward, yet traders can still stumble if they overlook a few nuances. The first trap is mismatched session opens. Because hollow logic relies on the relationship between open and close, using a broker whose server time resets daily candles at an odd hour (like 22:00 GMT) may skew your perception of which side “won” the bar. Always sync session times with the geographic center of your trading plan. London opens if you trade Europe, and New York opens for U.S. releases.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Color selection is another overlooked issue. Some platforms default to faint outlines that blur when you zoom out, erasing the added benefit of the hollow format. Spend five minutes customizing a bold outline and a neutral fill so the empty/filled contrast leaps off the screen at any resolution.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Finally, give your muscle memory time to catch up. During the first week, you might instinctively interpret a filled body as bearish without checking whether it’s actually a down-close or simply below the open. To retrain quickly, overlay a small text label showing “BULL” or “BEAR” next to each bar for a few sessions. Once your brain rewires, remove the crutch and enjoy the cleaner chart.</p><p dir=""ltr"">To put it briefly, it is possible to have much more graphic detail and a more serene decision environment in hollow candles, at practically no cost. Standard candles are still quite viable, particularly to those traders who have already mastered reading them in pressure situations. Give hollow candles a test run on your analysis charts and let the numbers and your nerves determine whether or not they will have a permanent place in your toolbox.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,Three-Line Break vs. Traditional Candlestick Charts: Which Reveals More?,"<p>Chart-watching is the heartbeat of every technically minded forex trader. Most of us were raised on the classic Japanese candlestick, and for good reason: it compresses four critical data points, open, high, low, close, into a single, glanceable icon.</p><p>

Yet a quieter, time-independent cousin called the <a href=""https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader-indicators/Three-Line-Break/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">three-line break chart</a> (often abbreviated TLB) has been nudging its way onto professional screens. Is it just another exotic visualization, or does it genuinely reveal something candles miss? Let’s put the two chart types under the microscope and see which one earns a more permanent spot in your trading arsenal.</p><p>The Backbone: How Traditional Candlestick Charts Communicate Price</p><p>A quick refresher (skip ahead if you live and breathe candlesticks):</p><p>Construction: Each candle represents a fixed unit of time, one minute, an hour, a day, depending on the chart setting. The body depicts the distance between open and closed; the wicks show excursion beyond those levels.</p><p>Immediate Benefits:
</p><ol><li>
Instant readout of market sentiment. Thick bullish bodies scream optimism; long upper shadows whisper “supply overhead.”
</li><li>Rich pattern language engulfing, morning stars, dojis that have been tested for centuries.
</li><li>Universally available on every forex platform from MetaTrader 4 to TradingView.
</li></ol><p>Key Drawback: Because candles print with the relentless tick-tock of time, they often contain a lot of “noise.” A choppy, low-volume afternoon can produce a dozen candles that contribute little insight yet still tempt traders into over-analysis.
</p><p>Bottom line: Candlesticks are the Swiss Army knife of price action, but they can chatter too much in ranging markets.</p><p>Three-Line Break Charts: A Time-Agnostic Perspective for FX and CFD Traders
</p><p>Three-Line Break charts were popularized in Japan alongside Renko and Kagi, though they remain underutilized in Western retail trading circles. Here’s why they deserve your attention, especially if you’re juggling both spot forex and CFDs at multi-asset brokers:
</p><p>Construction Rules:
</p><ol><li>
A new “line” is printed in the same direction as the previous one if the price exceeds the high (for bullish) or low (for bearish) of the most recent line.
</li><li>A <a href=""https://www.tradingpedia.com/price-action-trading/trend-channel-line-overshoots-leading-to-reversals/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">reversal line</a> forms only if the price closes beyond the extreme of the prior three lines in the opposite direction.
</li><li>Time is irrelevant. One line could summarize a five-minute burst or three days of drifting.</li></ol><p>Why That Matters for CFD Traders: Many forex brokers now offer CFDs on indices, commodities, and crypto alongside major pairs. These instruments often display different volatility regimes intraday. A single, time-based candle setting can leave you constantly tweaking charts when you hop from EUR/USD to WTI or the NASDAQ CFD. Three-Line Break, being price-driven rather than clock-driven, automatically adapts to each market’s rhythm. No need to hunt for the “perfect” five-minute versus 15-minute setting.
</p><p>Noise Filtration: Because small fluctuations that do not exceed the previous line’s extreme are ignored, TLB charts compress sideways drift. You end up focusing on consequential price shifts that break a meaningful threshold, exactly what swing and position traders care about.
</p><p>Visual Simplicity: The chart often looks like a stairway of thick bars instead of 100 flickering candles. That minimalist aesthetic makes support, resistance, and trend direction pop off the screen.</p><p>Head-to-Head: What Each Chart Type Reveals
</p><p>Let’s stack TLB and candlesticks side by side on a EUR/USD chart to evaluate four dimensions that matter to working traders.
</p><p>Trend Identification
</p><p>Candles. Moving averages and price angle help, but whipsaws in consolidations create false directional cues.
</p><p>TLB. The series of uninterrupted lines in one color simplifies trend direction. You won’t get a trend change signal until price has closed decisively past the last three lines, which filters minor retracements.
</p><p>Takeaway. If your primary objective is staying with big moves and ignoring micro pullbacks, TLB has the edge.
</p><p>Noise and Emotional Discipline</p><p>We’ve all been there: a 10-pip wiggle triggers a candle reversal shape, you jump out, and then the market resumes the original move. TLB refuses to print new bars for those wiggles, promoting patience. For traders who acknowledge that <a href=""https://www.binance.com/uk-UA/square/post/1089677"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over-trading is their kryptonite</a>, TLB can act like a built-in circuit breaker.
</p><p>Early Reversal Signals
</p><p>Candles can telegraph a reversal via hammer, shooting star, or bullish engulfing pattern within a single bar, no waiting for three bars. TLB, in contrast, purposely delays the reversal confirmation until price has convincingly pushed through a three-bar extreme. The choice boils down to risk appetite:
</p><ul><li>Need an early heads-up? Stick with candles but validate with momentum or volume indicators.
</li><li>Prefer a higher-confidence, lower-frequency entry? TLB delivers.
</li></ul><p>Strategy Compatibility
</p><p>Algo and Quant Approaches. Candles offer four data points per bar, feeding richer inputs into machine-learning or statistical models. TLB provides only the close, which simplifies but may remove nuance.</p><p>Manual Discretionary Trading. TLB can reduce analysis time because you’re scanning fewer bars. That efficiency is handy when monitoring multiple CFD instruments plus six forex majors.
</p><p>Practical Use Cases and Hybrid Workflows
</p><p>Most experienced analysts end up combining chart types rather than choosing between them. Here are three field-tested workflows:</p><p>

Primary Trend with TLB, Timing with Candles:
</p><ul><li>
Keep a daily TLB chart open to map the macro trend.
</li><li>Drill down to a 30-minute candlestick chart for intraday entries once the trend is identified.
</li></ul><p>
CFD Basket Synchronization: </p><ul><li>

Plot TLB charts on correlated assets, e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and the Dollar Index CFD.
</li><li>A simultaneous reversal line across the basket often foreshadows a broader USD move.
</li></ul><p>
Risk Management Overlay:
</p><ul><li>Use the most recent TLB reversal level as a hard stop.
</li><li>Trail exits on the candle chart using ATR or moving-average techniques for a tighter, profit-protecting stop.
</li></ul><p>Implementation Tips, Pitfalls, and Platform Support
</p><p>Choosing the “Break” Parameter:</p><p>The traditional definition uses three lines, but most platforms allow you to customize to two or five. Testing shows:
</p><ul><li>Two-Line Break = hyper-sensitive, behaves almost like a Renko brick.
</li><li>Five-Line Break = extremely conservative; you may miss early portions of a trend.
</li><li>Three is the Goldilocks setting for most liquid forex pairs and CFDs.
</li></ul><p>
Data Feed and Broker Differences:
</p><p>
Not all CFD-friendly forex brokers stream identical price feeds, especially during low-liquidity rollover hours. Gaps can distort TLB reversals more than they do candles. Always back-test with the same broker feed you’ll trade live.
</p><p>
Software Availability:
</p><ul><li>MetaTrader 4/5.TLB indicators exist but often as custom add-ons; verify coding quality.
</li><li>TradingView. Native support simply changes the chart type.
</li><li>cTrader and NinjaTrader. Available via free community plugins.</li></ul><p>So, Which Reveals More?</p><p>
The honest answer: each reveals something the other hides.
</p><ul><li>Candlesticks excel at microstructure insights and order-flow hints captured by wick length and body ratio. They cater to scalpers, news traders, and anyone needing second-by-second pulse checks.
</li><li>Three-Line Break strips away time noise, pulls focus onto consequential price shifts, and fits traders hunting higher-probability setups on forex majors and the CFD roster.
</li><li>Many professionals eventually adopt a dual-lens approach: let TLB set the strategic backdrop and use candlesticks for tactical execution. That arrangement offers a balanced diet of patience and precision.
</li></ul><p>Final Thoughts
</p><p>Market analysis isn’t a beauty contest between chart types; it’s a utility test. Does the tool help you make clearer, faster, more disciplined decisions? In that spirit, open a demo account with your CFD-enabled forex broker and overlay TLB on your usual pairs. Scroll back a few months, note how many whipsaw candle signals would have been filtered out, and evaluate whether the trade-off sometimes entering later suits your psychology and system.
</p><p>
Remember, charts are storytellers. Candlesticks whisper every subplot, while Three-Line Break narrates only the main storyline. Decide which voice you need to hear more clearly, and let that guide your next trade.

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,EURUSD Technical Analysis – French political drama and US data in focus,"<p>Fundamental
Overview</p><p>The USD recovered some of
the losses triggered by Powell’s dovish tilt at the Jackson Hole Symposium. Traders
are now focused on the US labour market data due next week that will culminate
with a crucial NFP report on Friday. In fact, the data will influence interest
rates expectations greatly.</p><p>Right now, the market is
pricing an 89% probability of a rate cut in September and a total of 55 bps of
easing by year-end. Strong data might take the probability for a September cut
towards a 50/50 chance but will certainly see a more hawkish repricing further
down the curve and support the dollar. Soft data, on the other hand, will
likely see traders increasing the dovish bets with a third cut by year-end
being priced in and weighing on the greenback.</p><p>On the EUR side, the currency
weakened across the board in the first part of the week due to some French
politics drama. On Monday, the French Prime Minister called for a confidence
vote on September 8 and the markets priced in a collapse given that he’s
expected to lose. Other than that, we haven’t got anything new in terms of
fundamentals. </p><p>Many ECB members are now
taking a much more neutral approach to rate cuts. They will need significant
negative data to force them to cut further. The market is pricing just 9 bps of
easing by year-end and 20 bps by the end of 2026, which indicates that the
easing cycle might have already ended. </p><p>EURUSD Technical
Analysis – Daily Timeframe</p><p>On the daily chart, we can
see that EURUSD rejected the major <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/"">trendline</a> around the 1.1740 level and eventually
pulled all the way back to the key <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/"">support</a> around the 1.16 handle. That’s
where the buyers stepped in once again to position for a rally back into the
trendline. The sellers will need a break below the support to open the door for
a drop into the 1.14 handle next.</p><p>EURUSD Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can
see more clearly the strong bounce from the 1.16 support. We now have the most
recent swing high at 1.1664 that could act as resistance. That’s where we can
expect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the level to position
for a break below the 1.16 support. The buyers, on the other hand, will look
for a break higher to increase the bullish bets into the major trendline.</p><p>EURUSD Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have the most recent swing low around
1.1627 that act as support. Overall, the price action will likely be messy as
we head into the key US labour market data, so we could see many fakeouts. </p><p>Nonetheless, we can expect the buyers to step in at the minor support with
a defined risk below it to position for a rally into the major trendline. The
sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to position for a drop
back into the 1.16 support. The red lines define the <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/"">average daily range</a> for today.</p><p>Upcoming

tradeCompass is built around clear thresholds that define bullish or bearish bias. Once a level is sustainably crossed, it signals a valid direction. Traders avoid overtrading by respecting the rule: one trade per direction per day.</p><p>Value Area (VAH, VAL, POC)
The Value Area High (VAH) and Low (VAL) mark where about 70% of trading volume occurred during a session. The Point of Control (POC) is the single price with the most traded volume. These levels act as magnets and decision points—often where price stalls or reverses.</p><p>VWAP
The Volume-Weighted Average Price represents the “fair value” of a session. Price action around VWAP often reflects the ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Deviations above/below VWAP frequently highlight imbalance zones or liquidity pockets, making them prime areas for partial profit-taking or stops.</p><p>Nasdaq Trade Management Using the tradeCompass Approach</p><ul><li><p>Only one trade per direction per day according to tradeCompass.</p></li><li><p>Always move stops to entry after securing partial profits (typically after the second target).</p></li><li><p>Use micros instead of e-minis (or CFDs with enough size) to enable scaling out into multiple profit targets.</p></li><li><p>Stop-losses should always be placed logically beyond the opposite threshold—never further.</p></li></ul><p>Final Note & Disclaimer for Today's Nasdaq Traders</p><p>While today’s market may appear influenced by NVIDIA’s earnings volatility, tradeCompass levels provide a structured map for NASDAQ traders.

Overview</p><p>Gold continued to edge
higher this week following Powell’s dovish tilt last Friday. Inflation
expectations kept on climbing, while Treasury yields have not gone anywhere.
That caused real yields to fall giving further support to gold prices.  </p><p>The focus is now on the US
labour market data that will culminate with the NFP report next Friday. Strong
data might take the probability for a September cut towards a 50/50 chance but
will certainly see a more hawkish repricing further down the curve and weigh on
gold. </p><p>Soft data, on the other
hand, will likely see traders increasing the dovish bets with a third cut by
year-end being priced in and giving gold another boost.</p><p>In the bigger picture, gold
should remain in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid
Fed easing given their dovish reaction function. In the short-term though, hawkish
repricing in interest rates expectations will likely keep on triggering corrections.</p><p>Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe</p><p>On the daily chart, we can
see that gold has been slowly climbing towards the key 3,438 <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/"">resistance</a>. If the price gets there, we can
expect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the resistance to
position for a drop back into the 3,245 support. The buyers, on the other hand,
will want to see the price breaking higher to extend the rally into the 3,500
level next.</p><p>Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor upward <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/"">trendline</a>
defining the bullish momentum on this timeframe. The buyers will likely
continue to lean on the trendline with a defined risk below it to keep pushing
into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to target a
pullback into the 3,350 level next.</p><p>Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s
not much else we can add here as the buyers will continue to pile in around
these levels, while the sellers will look for a break below the trendline to position
for a drop into the 3,350 level. The red lines define the <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/"">average daily range</a> for today.</p><p>Upcoming

Nvidia earnings earlier saw a beat on the results but China uncertainty and weaker-than-expected sales from its data center business is offering up some caution. The tech giant saw shares dip after hours and that's weighing as we look to the session ahead. S&P 500 futures are down 0.1% with Nasdaq futures down 0.3%. Dow futures are up 0.1% though.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,What are the main events for today?,"<p>In the European session, we don't have much on the agenda other than a few low-tier releases like the final Swiss Q2 GDP or the final Eurozone consumer confidence. None of these data will change anything in terms of market pricing. </p><p>In the American session, we have the second estimate of the US Q2 GDP and the US Jobless Claims data. The GDP data will of course be ignored since it's very old news, while the jobless claims figures could be market-moving if we get notable deviations.</p><p>Initial claims are expected at 230K vs 235K prior, while continuing claims are seen at 1970K vs 1972K prior. The data has been pointing to a ""low firing, low hiring"" labour market, which is understandable given all the tariffs mess we had in the first part of the year. </p><p>That is now behind us though, and the labour market could start to be more active again. Some regional surveys already showed a pick up in activity in August. We will see how that will translate into the more followed jobless claims, ADP and NFP data.</p>

1756386040,https://www.forexlive.com/feed/,The X Open Hub Whitepaper: A Broker's Playbook for Growth,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The environment for brokers is more demanding than ever. Your clients expect flawless execution and diverse asset options. Regulators impose complex reporting requirements. All the while, intense competition puts constant pressure on your margins. The strategies that built your business may not be sufficient to secure its future. To grow, you need to operate smarter, scale faster, and find a long-term competitive advantage.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Recognising these difficulties, the institutional liquidity and technology provider X Open Hub has released a strategic whitepaper. The document examines the most significant challenges brokers will face in 2025 and offers a clear playbook on how to address them. It is a guide for turning pressure points into growth opportunities through robust infrastructure, intelligent automation, and innovative liquidity partnerships.</p><p>Confronting a shrinking profit landscape</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Your firm's profitability is affected by multiple vectors. Margins are tightening across the industry, forcing you to find new ways to maintain healthy margins. Relying on a limited range of products is no longer a viable long-term strategy. To thrive, you must expand your offerings and give clients more reasons to trade with you. This requires access to deep, <a href=""https://xopenhub.pro/liquidity-provider/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">multi-asset liquidity</a> that allows you to introduce new instruments without creating operational bottlenecks.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">X Open Hub offers institutional-grade liquidity across more than 5,000 instruments. This includes Forex, indices, commodities, shares, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies. By connecting to a single, deep liquidity pool, you can broaden your product suite. This allows you to attract a broader client base and build new revenue streams, moving your business beyond a dependence on spread-based income alone.</p><p>Mastering regulatory demands with confidence</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The weight of regulation continues to grow. Reporting standards like EMIR and MiFIR demand accuracy, promptness, and transparency. For many brokers, meeting these obligations requires significant manual effort and dedicated resources, pulling focus from core business activities. Developing and maintaining an in-house system that keeps pace with changing rules is a costly and complex undertaking.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The right technology partner removes this burden. <a href=""https://xopenhub.pro/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">X Open Hub</a> provides a compliance-ready infrastructure designed to meet the standards of Tier-1 regulators. The platform features advanced, API-based technology and customised reporting tools. These systems automate data collection and formatting, helping you satisfy your regulatory duties efficiently and accurately. You can operate with confidence, knowing your reporting framework is built on a solid foundation. This frees your team to concentrate on serving clients and growing the business.</p><p>Building an Infrastructure for Scalability</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Growth is the goal, but your existing technology might be holding you back. Systems that cannot handle increased trading volumes or a larger client base will eventually fail, damaging your reputation and putting a ceiling on your success. True scalability means expanding your operations without sacrificing stability or control. It requires an infrastructure built from the ground up for high performance and reliability.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This is where a robust technological framework becomes essential. X Open Hub enables brokers to scale their operations with a strong infrastructure designed for growth. The platform is engineered to manage high-frequency trading and large order flows without performance degradation. Whether you are expanding into new regions or onboarding a large number of clients, the technology provides a stable backbone for your business. This allows you to pursue growth aggressively, secure in the knowledge that your systems can support your ambitions.</p><p>Uncompromised execution quality</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In a competitive market, clients have high expectations. Poor execution quality, demonstrated by slow fills or high slippage, will quickly drive them to your competitors. Delivering fast, reliable execution is fundamental to building and maintaining client trust. This depends entirely on the quality and depth of your liquidity sources. Shallow liquidity pools lead to wider spreads and inconsistent pricing, especially during volatile market conditions.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">To secure client loyalty, you must provide superior execution. X Open Hub’s deep, institutional-grade liquidity ensures consistent and reliable order fills. By connecting to a broad network of <a href=""https://xopenhub.pro/liquidity-provider/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">liquidity providers</a> through a single integration, you gain access to tight pricing and reduce the risk of slippage. This consistent performance builds credibility with your clients and strengthens your brand's reputation for quality and reliability.</p><p>Automating complexity in operations</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Manual processes are a drag on growth. They introduce the risk of human error, slow down critical functions like client onboarding, and make it difficult to get a clear view of your business. When data is siloed across different systems, you lack the visibility needed to make informed strategic decisions. Effective automation solves these problems by creating seamless workflows and unifying your operational data.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">X Open Hub’s solutions are designed to automate key operational challenges. The advanced, API-based technology streamlines everything from client onboarding to risk management. Customised reporting gives you clear, consolidated visibility across your entire operation, from trading activity to client profitability. By automating these functions, you increase efficiency, reduce operational risks, and unlock the data you need to manage your business effectively.</p><p>The partner for growth</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Navigating the modern market requires more than just technology. It requires a strategic partner dedicated to your success. With a presence in over 25 countries, X Open Hub has a global perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing brokers. The firm’s expertise is demonstrated by its recognition as the Best B2B Liquidity Provider at the UF Awards Global 2025. This is a testament to its commitment to providing superior liquidity and technology solutions.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The challenges facing brokers today are significant, but they are not insurmountable. With the right strategy and the right partner, you can overcome margin pressure, regulatory complexity, and operational hurdles. You can build a resilient, scalable business prepared for the future.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""https://xopenhub.pro/white-paper-2025-navigating-scaling-challenges-a-playbook-for-brokers/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Download the full X Open Hub white paper</a> to discover the eight biggest challenges brokers face in 2025, and how to turn them into growth opportunities.</p>

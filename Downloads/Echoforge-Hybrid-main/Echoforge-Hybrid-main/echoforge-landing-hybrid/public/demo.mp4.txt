# Demo Video Placeholder

To add your demo video:
1. Record a 30-60 second screen capture of:
   - Loading a sample dataset
   - Running anomaly detection
   - Viewing results with charts
   - Downloading evidence report

2. Export as MP4 (1080p recommended)

3. Replace this file with: public/demo.mp4

4. The video will auto-play in the hero section

For now, you can use a static screenshot or remove the video section.

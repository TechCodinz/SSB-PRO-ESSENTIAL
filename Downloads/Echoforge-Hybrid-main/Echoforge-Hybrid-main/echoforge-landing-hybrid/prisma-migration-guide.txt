⚠️ DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATE REQUIRED ⚠️

The application has new features (Pay As You Go) that require database updates.

OPTION 1: Quick Update (Development/Production)
-----------------------------------------------
Run this command to update your database:

  npx prisma db push

This will:
- Add tokenBalanceMicro column to users table
- Add metadata column to crypto_payments table  
- Add TOKEN_TRANSACTION to UsageType enum
- Add PAY_AS_YOU_GO to Plan enum

OPTION 2: Create Migration (Recommended for Production)
--------------------------------------------------------
Run these commands:

  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_payg_support
  npx prisma generate

This will:
- Create a migration file
- Apply changes to database
- Regenerate Prisma Client

OPTION 3: Skip PAYG Features (Temporary)
-----------------------------------------
If you don't want Pay As You Go features yet, the app will
work with graceful fallbacks. PAYG-specific features will
be disabled but everything else works fine.

Current Status:
- Sample datasets: ✅ Working (with fallback)
- Predictions: ✅ Working (demo mode)
- Analysis: ✅ Working (plan-based)
- PAYG: ⏸️ Requires migration

Run Option 1 or 2 to enable full PAYG support!
